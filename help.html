		<h2>What is Troff</h2>
		<p>
			Troff is a media player that let you loop a part of a song,
			slow it down and create markers on the song timeline.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is designed for practicing with music, it is perfect for dancers working
			on a choreography or for musicians learning to play a song.
		</p>
		<h3 id="about">About this guide</h3>
		<p>
			This guide often uses the word "song" instead of "song or movie".
		</p>
		<p>
			Keyboard shortcuts will be written inside of "()".
		</p>
		<p>
			Troff is laid out in different sections or areas.
			They will be referred to as areas in this guide.
		</p>

		<!--
Troff helps you with this by adding markers to the song timeline, making it easy to find the parts of the song you need to work on!

Adding a marker before and after a certain part of a song let you loop that part of the song automatically. This way you get the maximum amount of practice time.

Troff lets you easily change the tempo of the song, to let you work on harder parts slowly before you are ready for 100% or even faster!

Need to learn a routine from a movie? No problem; now Troff supports movies!
You can still use markers, change tempo and loop sequences with the film clip.

Troff is not connected to Drive, it plays your songs from your local hard-drive. This way it will work as well offline as online!

	<article id="howToAddMedia">
		<h2>How to add and play music or movies</h2>
		<p>
			When you start Troff, you must add songs! You can find songs on the find-page
			<a class="likeLink" href="/find.html" target="_blank">troff.app/find.html</a>
			or add songs from your computer or phone!
			Add from your computer by clicking the
			<label
				title="Add songs, videos or pictures to Troff"
				class="cursor-pointer mr-2 regularButton fa-stack">
					<i class="fa-music fa-stack-10x m-relative-7 font-size-relative-1" ></i>
					<i class="fa-plus fa-stack-10x m-relative-4 font-size-relative-65 "></i>
			</label>-button in the Songs area,
			select one or more songs or movies and click "Open".
			Then the songs and movies will be saved in Troff
			and displayed in the songs area.
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>Note: The files you add will be copied into your web browsers memory.
			This means that</p>
			<ol class="smallSize list-style-type-decimal ml-4">
				<li class="small">No data will be sent to the server (unless you share the song <a href="#shareViaLink">via link</a> or <a href="#shareSonglist">songlist</a>); your files will not leave your computer</li>
				<li class="small">
					If you remove or change the original files, your songs in Troff will still be intact
					(as long as the file-name is the same, you can import the file again to make the changes apply)
				</li>
				<li class="small">
					Your web-browser might decide to clear it's memory, for what ever reason,
					and then your songs and markers might disappear.
					So it's always good to keep the original files.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h3 id="howToRemoveMedia">Remove music or movies</h3>
		<p>
			In order to remove songs or movies,
			open the songlist in floating state.
			Select the files you want to remove,
			click the drop-down and select "Remove songs from Troff".
			After you confirm your selection, the songs will be removed.
		</p>
		<h3 id="howToPlayMedia">Play music or movies</h3>
		<p>
			When you have songs in the songs area,
			click a song and it will be selected. This is indicated by it becoming
			purple. When the song is loaded, the text "Wait for song to load" written
			in the top section, will be replaced by the song name, artist and album.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			Note: If the text "Wait for song to load" does not disappear,
			then Troff might not be able to play that particular song.
			Try to convert the song to mp3 (or movies to mp4) and try again.
		</p>
		<p>
			To play the song, press the round play-button in the top area or (Space),
			the song will then wait 3 seconds before start. If you don't want
			to wait 3 seconds, either press the Enter-key,
			or continue to read this guide.
		</p>
	</article> <!-- add and play music -->
	<article id="shareViaLink">
		<h2>Share the song via link!</h2>
		<p>
			There are two ways to share your songs and all the markers:
			via a link or with a <a href="#shareSonglist">songlist</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can upload your song along with all the markers and info to our servers,
			and then share a link to the song with anybody who needs to practice to the song!
			When people go to the link, they will get the song, all the markers and info
			so that they can start practising right a way!
		</p>
		<p>
			This is great if you have a team where everybody needs to work on the same song.
			Then only one needs to prepare the markers!
		</p>
		<p>
			You upload and share the song via the <i class="fa-share"></i>-button
			above the play-button.
		</p>
		<h3 id="theUrlInTheAddressBar">The Url in the address bar</h3>
		<p>
			Songs that are uploaded to the server will display the sharable address in the url-bar.
			However, if the markers, song info or states are changed, the url will be reset to troff.app.<br />
			If you want to share the newly edited markers, simply click the share button again,
			and you will get a new link to the new markers.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the same way, if the people who have downloaded your song edit the markers,
			their url will be reset to troff.app.
			And in order for you to get their new markers, they will have to click the share button,
			and you will have to go to their link.
		</p>
		<p>
			You will then get a choice if you want to import the new markers, keep your existing markers or
			merge the markers.
		</p>
		<h3 id="history">History of your downloaded versions</h3>
		<p>
			When you share or download a song,
			that songs url is saved in the find page!
			So if you have edited the markers and want to get back to an old version,
			you can find it at <a class="likeLink" href="/find.html#f=my">troff.app/history.html</a>
		</p>
		<h3 id="find">Find publicly shared songs</h3>
		<p>
			Songs, along with their markers, that are shared publicly can be found by anyone at the
			<a class="likeLink" href="/find.html">troff.app/find.html</a>.
			Here you will se both all the public songs and the versions you have downloaded.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can toggle only watching your downloaded history under <u>Settings</u>
			and then activate "Only my versions".
		</p>
	</article> <!-- shareViaLink -->
	<article id="shareSonglist">
		<h2>Share songlists</h3>
		<p>
			If you are signed in, you can share
			<a href="#songLists">songlists</a> with other users
			that are also signed in!
		</p>
		<p>
			Simply edit the songlist and click the
			<button class="regularButton">Share!</button>-button
			in the lower right corner.
			Then you will be able to add new users to the songlist
			by entering the email-adress that they use.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next time those users sign in,
			they will receive the songlist with all the songs
			and markers, and whats more,
			if you or they update the markers,
			or add new songs to the songlist,
			all the other people in that songlist will receive those
			updates!
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a perfect way for a team or group to work together
			on routines:
			Everybody will always have the same songs,
			and the latest versions!
		</p>

		<p>
			You can also personalize your shared songlists with a logo
			and a color! That way
		</p>

		<div class="note groupIndication ">
			<p>
				Note: you can recognize songs that are in a shared songlist,
				via the line on the left of the song in the songlist.
				(sort of like the line to the left of this note)
			</p>
			<p>
				If you select a song that is in a shared songlist,
				you will also see it by the line on the left of the
				markerlist and the settings area.
			</p>
			<p>
				The color of the line depends on your theme.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3 id="emovingSongsOrUsers">Removing songs or users</h3>
		<p>
			If you remove a song from a shared songlist,
			the song will be removed from the songlist for all users
			BUT, it will not be removed from any users computer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Similarly, if you remove a user from a songlist,
			that user will not receive updates made to the songs in that
			songlist, but they will still have all the songs and the songlist
			on there computer, just not a shared songlist.
		</p>
		<h3 id="stopSharing">Stop sharing</h3>
		<p>
			When you stop sharing a songlist
			you will still have the songlist on your computer,
			but the other users will no longer get updates
			you make to the songs,
			and you will not receive updates that they make.
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				Note: Users you add to the songlist have access to the same functionality as you do.
				This means that they can
			</p>
			<ol class="smallSize list-style-type-decimal ml-4">
				<li class="small">Edit markers and info on songs</li>
				<li class="small">Edit the songlist info</li>
				<li class="small">Add and remove songs</li>
				<li class="small">Add and remove users, including you</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				So, only add users you share a common goal with!
			</p>
		</div>

	<article id="globalSettings">
	<h2>Global settings</h2>
		<p>
			Troff have a song-specific settings area
			(explained below: <a href="#settings">The settings area</a>)
			as well as global settings.
			The global settings is where you configure Troff to look and behave
			the way you like it. These settings will be applied regardless of what
			song is selected.
		</p>
		<p>
			You access the global settings via the <i class="fa-cog"></i>-button
			in the top left corner.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here you decide the theme of Troff,
			how the marker-color, songlist, space, enter, select marker
			and delete marker will behave
			and what areas of Troff that should be visible.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also set what the default values for the setting should be.
		</p>
	</article> <!-- globalSettings -->
	<article id="settings">
		<h2>The settings area</h2>
			<p>
				The settings area is where you configure Troff to play the current
				song the way you like it. Here you decide how fast the song will
				be played, how many times, which part of the song that will be played
				and more.
			</p>
		<h3 id="markers">Markers - what are those?</h3>
		<p>
			Markers are labels that you can add to the timeline.
			The timeline in Troff is vertical and stretches the full height of the
			player.
			The markers contain text, and can be colorized so that you easy can
			find specific parts of the song later.
		</p>
		<p>
			To add a marker, press "Add marker!" or (M), then the "create new marker"
			dialog appears, here you can write the marker name (will be visible
			on the timeline).
		</p>
		<p>
			The marker will be added to the timeline where the cursor was when you
			pressed the button, but the location of the marker can be adjusted in the
			"create new marker" dialog.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the info-area you can add more info to the marker.
			This will not take up space on the timeline but will be easily
			accessible at the <a href="#infoArea">info part</a>.
			This dialog also lets you decide the color of the marker.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can always press the edit button (<i class="fa-pencil"></i>) next
			to a marker to bring up the same dialog to edit the marker.
		</p>
		<h3 id="playPartOfSong">Play only part of a song</h3>
		<p>
			If you want to play only a part of a song, click the marker where you
			want to start and the marker will be selected (indicated by the purple
			color). Then click the "stop" button next to the marker where you want Troff
			to stop playing, the purple color indicates that the "stop" button is
			selected.
			When you press "play" only the selected part of the song will be played,
			the selected part is shown in purple on the timeline.

		<p>
			This is a great way to focus on tricky parts of the song.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			Note: You might have noticed that the purple color of the timeline
			changed when
			you select start and stop-markers. The purple part is the
			"active playing region" and indicates simply where Troff will
			start and end.
		</p>
		<p>
			If Troff should start playing at the beginning of the active playing region,
			when pressing space, enter or the play pause button,
			can be edited in the Global Settings.<br />
			But you can always move the cursor to the beginning by pressing "G",
			as in "Go to marker".
		</p>

		<h3 id="playFullSong">play full song</h3>
			<p>
				If you have a small part selected and want to play the whole song
				you can either press the name of the first marker, and then the
				stop-button of the last marker, or you can press "play full song" or (U)
				to select the first and last marker.
			</p>
		<h3 id="exportImport">Export and import</h3>
			<p>
				If you want to share your markers to someone,
				the members of your show-team or band for instance,
				use the share-button explained in the <a href="#shareViaLink">"Share the song"</a>-section.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, there is a manuel way to share everything except the song itself.
				If you want to share the markers manually, press "advanced" followed by "import / export" and
				the import export dialog appears.
			</p>
			<p class="note">
				Note: When you export, not only will your markers, marker-info,
				marker-color
				be exported, but the <a href="#states">states</a>,
				settings and <a href="#songInfo">song-info</a> as well. <br />
				More on that later.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you are exporting you will get a long text-string.
				Copy the text and share it with your friends that want to import
				your settings.
			</p>
			<p>
				To import settings, click on "advanced" followed by "import / export" and then "import", paste the
				the text-string in the text-box and click ok.
			</p>
			<p class="note">
				Note: If you miss a single sign or character when copying or pasting,
				the import will not work. Then, just try again.
			</p>
		<h3 id="copyMarkers">copy markers</h3>
		<p>
			You can copy you markers to another place in the song.
			This is helpful if you repeat the routine or the song repeats itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Simply select the first and last marker of the markers that you want to copy.
			Then click "advanced" followed by "copy markers",
			and input to what time you want to copy the markers
			and click "copy markers".
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			Note: If you are not satisfied with the result,
			you have 5 seconds to hit undo in the
			notification pop up in the top right corner.
		</p>
		<h3 id="moveMarkers">move markers</h3>
		<p>
			There are a number of ways in which you can change the time of, or
			move, a marker.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you press (Shift + Up/Down), (Alt + Up/Down) or (Shift + Alt + Up/Down)
			the selected marker will move Up/Down by 1, 0.08 or 8 seconds
			respectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also click the edit button of the marker,
			and change the time there.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you click "advanced" followed by "move markers" you can move all markers at the same time,
			or just the markers between the two selected ones
			(including the selected markers).
		</p>
		<h3 id="deleteMarkers">Delete markers</h3>
		<p>
			There are a number of ways in which you can delete one or several markers.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can click the edit button of the marker, and then press remove.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you click "advanced" followed by "delete markers" you will get an option to
			delete all markers at the same time,
			or just the markers between the two selected ones
			(including the selected markers).
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			When a marker is deleted, there will be a notification square letting you know
			that the marker has been deleted, as well as an undo-button in the top right corner.
		</p>
		<h3 id="stretchMarkers">Stretch markers</h3>
		<p>
			If you have markers for a song, and then stretch the length of the song in an external program
			(for instance; using Audacity going to Effect > Change Tempo)
			then the markers will no longer match the new length of the song.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then you can stretch the markers. click "advanced" followed by "stretch markers".
			stretching the markers to 200% will create
			twice as much space between the markers as before.
			Stretching them to 50% will reduce the space to half.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			There is no "undo" functionality when stretching markers,
			therefore it is recommended to export your markers and settings first
			so that you can undo the stretch if it did not match your desired result.
		</p>
		<h3 id="zoomOnTheTimeline">Zoom on the timeline</h3>
		<p>
			In Troff, you can zoom in on the timeline which makes it easier to for
			example focus on a 3 minute song in an 1 hour movie,
			or just to focus on a few bars in a song.
		</p>
		<p>
			You zoom by pressing "Zoom" or (Z), this will zoom the timeline to the
			active playing region, hence select a marker before and after the area you
			want to zoom to and press (Z).
		</p>
		<p>
			To zoom out, either select the first and last marker
			(by "play full song" or (U) ) or press "zoom out" (shift + Z)
		</p>


		<h3 id="startBeforeStopAfter">Start before and stop after</h3>
		<p>
			One way to work with markers is to set a marker at the start of every bar.
			Then have good short names for the markers and maybe colorize them in a
			way so that they are easy to understand.
			This way, it is easy to find the particular part you want to practice.
			However, you might not want Troff to start playing from the first beat,
			but rather 3 seconds or so before, so that you can prepare.
		</p>
		<p>
			Troff lets you do exactly this with the "start before" functionality.
			If you toggle "start before" or (B) you will se that the
			"active playing region" will change. If "start before" is active,
			Troff will start to play the song a few seconds before the selected
			marker.
		</p>
		<p>
			The number of seconds can be changed in the start before-number box,
			or can be increased or decreased by (shift + B) and (alt + B)
			respectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			"stop after" works in the same way but for the stop-selected marker.
		</p>
		<h3 id="loop">Play more than once</h3>
		<p>
			You can loop the selected playing region a number of times
			by pressing the number of times you want it to play.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you press "&infin;", Troff will loop the selected part of the song
			until you pause it.
		</p>
		<h3 id="pauses">Pause and wait</h3>
			<p>
				As default, Troff waits 3 seconds before starting to play a song.
				This way you can hit play, and then have time to get in position
				before the song starts.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can change the number of seconds Troff pauses before starting to
				play by changing the number in the "pause before"-number box
				or by (shift + P) and (alt + P).
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also quickly toggle if Troff should pause or not by pressing
				"pause before" (P).
			</p>
			<p>
				"Wait between" works in the same way as "pause before" but it changes
				the time Troff will wait between loops. It lets you catch your breath
				before doing it again!
			</p>
		<h3 id="volumeAndSpeed">Volume and speed</h3>
		<p>
			Troff let you control the volume and speed of the song with a slider,
			or by using the "+" and "-" buttons.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you press "Volume" (V) or "Speed" (S) you will reset the values to
			100%.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also increase or decrease the volume or speed by
			(shift/alt + V) or (shift/alt + S) respectively.
		</p>

		<h2>The info area</h2>
		<p>
			The info area is an area where you can take and read notes regarding
			the current song or marker and check the tempo of a song.
			If you play a movie in Troff, this will be displayed in the info area.
		</p>
		<h3 id="tapTempo">Tap tempo</h3>
		<p>
			If you repeatedly tap "Tempo" (T) to the tempo of the song,
			Troff will calculate the tempo and display it. This tempo will be saved
			for the particular song.
		</p>
		<h3 id="songInfo">Song info</h3>
		<p>
			In the song info, you can write notes and information regarding
			the current song. These notes will be saved per song and are
			easily accessible by selecting the song.
		</p>
		<h3 id="markerInfo">Marker info</h3>
		<p>
			The marker info works like the song info, but the text written there
			will be saved per marker. Hence, when another marker is selected,
			the text displayed will change.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a great way to write things that you want to remember for
			a specific part of the song.
		</p>
	</article> <!-- the info area -->
	<article id="countdown">
		<h2>The countdown area</h2>
		<p>
			The countdown area shows two things: <br />
			The top-number shows the number of seconds until the song will start.
				It will count down during the "pause before" and the "wait between".
			<br />
			The bottom-number shows the number of loops that are left.
				It will count down for each time one loop is finished.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			Note: The order of the two numbers match the order that you control
			these values in the Settings-area.
		</p>
	</article> <!-- countdown -->
	<article id="songsArea">
		<h2>The songs area</h2>
		<p>
			The song area is where you can select which song to play.
			The selected song is purple. If you can't find the song you want,
			it might be in another songlist, or it has been removed from the computer.
		</p>
		<p>
			The song area can either be in the attached state, then it will be next to the
			states and settings, or it can be in the floating state,
			then it be in a pop-up square.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can change between the two states in the settings,
			or with the maximize (<i class="fa-window-maximize"></i>)
			and minimize (<i class="fa-window-minimize"></i>) buttons.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the song is in the floating state,
			more info is available about the song in a sortable table.
		</p>
	</article> <!-- songs Area -->
	<article id="songLists">
		<h2>The songlists area</h2>
		<!--explain new songlist - how it works with folders / directories and how to create own songlists :) -->
		<p>
			You can create songlists to only show a few songs in the songs area.
		</p>
		<p>
			Open the songlist by clicking <i class="fa-columns"></i> in the attached state
			or by clicking the "songlist"-button in the floating state.
		</p>
		<p>
			To create a new songlist, click "New songlist", give it a name.
		</p>
		<h3 id="addSongsToSonglists">Add songs to songlists</h3>
		<p>
			There are two ways to add songs to songlists:<br />
			You can click and drag songs on to songlists to add them.<br />
			In the floating state, you can also select
			the checkbox next to every song you want to add and then click the dropdown and select "Add to ...",
			then all those songs will be added to that songlist.
			The same way makes it also possible to remove songs from songlist, just select
			"Remove from ...." instead.
		</p>

	<article id="states">
		<h2>The states area</h2>
		<h3 id="whatIsStates">What is states</h3>
		<p>
			A "state" is something that saves all the values in the settings-area
			as well as all markers selected.
		</p>
		<p>
			To understand when this is useful, imagine the following scenario:
		</p>
		<p>
			Lets say you usually practice a guitar solo of the song.
			Then you always set the same markers, always set start before to
			10 seconds and pause before set to off.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lets say you also practise the ending of the song.
			Then you have a different set of markers and start before is set to
			3 seconds, and pause before is set to 3 seconds.
		</p>
		<p>
			States lets you quickly switch between these.
		</p>
		<h3 id="howToUseStates">How to use a state</h3>
		<p>
			Select the markers and settings you want to save then click
			"remember state". Name the state and press "OK".
		</p>
		<p>
			The state will appear as a button in the states list.
			When you have another marker selected, you can simply press this state
			to recall the state.
		</p>
		<p>
			Remove a state by pressing the "R"-button next to it.
		</p>
	</article> <!-- states -->
	<article id="toggleAreas">
		<h2>Toggle areas</h2>
		<p>
			The areas explained in this guide can be toggled on and off.
			Press the buttons in the top section of the area you want to toggle.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			Note: If an area is visible or not is saved with the song.
		</p>
	</article> <!-- toggle areas -->
	<article id="howToPlayMovies">
		<h2>Play movies</h2>
		<p>
			If you select a movie in the songlist that Troff is able to show,
			the movie will be shown in the info area.
			(Except for on iOS, where the operating system will decide how you will enjoy the movie)
		</p>
		<h3 id="fullscreen">Fullscreen</h3>
		<p>
			You can at any time toggle fullscreen by the (F)-key.
		</p>
		<p>
			The "Play in Fullscreen"-button does not toggle fullscreen,
			but toggles whether or not Troff should enter fullscreen on play
			and exit fullscreen on pause.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			Note: If you pause Troff and Troff exits fullscreen
			(because "play in fullscreen" is active), simply press (F) to enter
			fullscreen again.
		</p>
		<h3 id="frameByFrame">Frame by frame stepping</h3>
		<p>
			Troff lets you examine what is happening in the movie in detail by
			allowing frame by frame stepping:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Use (alt + left / right arrow) to step one frame forward or backward.
			</li>
			<li>
				Use (left / right arrow) to step one second forward or backward.
			</li>
			<li>
				Use (shift + left / right arrow) to step 10 seconds forward or backward.
			</li>
		</ul>
