# Troff

Troff - training with music, a music player for dancers or musicians
who needs to practice dance-steps or instruments to music.

# setup:

'npm install'

'npm run copy'

## run the app localy:

'npm run dev'

## test build

This is a **composite** script that runs: linting, type checking, and building sequentially
(ie 'npm run lint', 'npm run typecheck', 'npm run build')

'npm run build:check'

So that is your _one stop shop_ for checking if your code is ready for production!
