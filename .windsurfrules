Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Web Components, npm, Workbox, ESLint
Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Storage, Analytics)
Monitoring: Sentry.IO
Deployment: GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions (TS→JS compilation to dist/)

Ground Rules:

1. Explain all changes and reasoning before implementing. Wait for my approval on significant changes.
2. Search through code thoroughly - check multiple files to understand context before suggesting changes.
3. When multiple approaches exist, present options with pros/cons and your recommendation, then wait for my decision.
4. Be thorough in code analysis - accuracy over speed.
5. Ensure WebKit + Chromium compatibility (no Customized built-in elements or browser-specific features).

HTML:

Icons:

- Use SVG icons from assets/icons/ directory
- When creating new icons:
  - Set fill="currentColor" and stroke="currentColor" to inherit CSS color
  - Use width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" for consistency
  - Match the style of existing icons in that directory (check existing files first)
  - Save new icons in assets/icons/ with descriptive kebab-case names
- Avoid external icon libraries (we're moving away from Fontello)

Styling:

- Use CSS variables defined at the top of ./style.css rather than hardcoded values
- Check existing variables before suggesting new ones.
- Mobile-first CSS: base styles are for mobile, use @media (min-width: 576px) for larger screens only when necessary. Never use max-width media queries.
- Avoid inline style on elements!

I hope this sounds like good ground rules!
Thanks!
